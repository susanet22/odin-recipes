    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Makes 1 cake</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 c (120 g) flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 c (120 g) butter</li>
        <li>2/3 c (130 g) sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rum (optional)</li>
        <li>2 apples, peeled and cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter a springform pan and preheat the oven to 180Â°C.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar by hand or with a mixer.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, then the vanilla and rum (if using). Don't worry if the batter is lumpy.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour mixture, and then fold in the apples.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan. It won't seem like a lot, so spread it out as best you can.</li>
